# Minimum K Flips to Make Binary Array Consistent (Go Solution)

This Go package (`main`) provides a function `minKBitFlips` to compute the minimum number of flips required to make a binary array consistent within every `k` consecutive elements.

## Function: minKBitFlips

The `minKBitFlips` function takes two parameters:
- `nums []int`: A binary array where each element is either `0` or `1`.
- `k int`: An integer representing the length of the subarray to flip.

---

### How It Works

The function utilizes a sliding window approach combined with a difference array (`diff`) to efficiently calculate the number of flips needed:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
   - `flipCount` keeps track of the total number of flips performed.
   - `diff` is an array initialized with zeros of length `n+1` used to manage flip operations.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - `flip` accumulates the effect of previous flips.
   - Iterate through each element of `nums`.
   
3. **Condition Check**:
   - Calculate `nums[i] + flip` to determine if a flip is needed.
   - If flipping is required:
     - Increment `flipCount`.
     - Update `flip` and adjust `diff` accordingly to mark the end of the flip range.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - If flipping extends beyond the array's length (`i + k > n`), return `-1` indicating it's impossible to make the array consistent.

5. **Return**:
   - After processing all elements, return `flipCount`, which represents the minimum number of flips required.

### Usage

1. Define a binary array `nums`.
2. Specify the length `k` for the subarray to flip.
3. Call `minKBitFlips(nums, k)` to obtain the minimum flips needed.
