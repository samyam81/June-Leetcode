# Magnetic Force Between Two Balls : June 20

### Intuition
The problem aims to determine the maximum possible minimum distance (`d`) such that `m` cows can be positioned in a sorted array `position` with at least `d` distance apart from each other.

### Approach
1. **Sorting**: Begin by sorting the `position` array, allowing straightforward calculation of distances between positions.

2. **Binary Search**: Utilize binary search to efficiently pinpoint the maximum distance `d`:
   - **Initialization**: Start with `low` set to 1 (minimum possible distance) and compute `high` based on the maximum possible distance between the first and last elements of `position`, divided by `(m-1)`.
   - **Binary Search Execution**: 
     - Calculate `mid` as the midpoint between `low` and `high`.
     - Use the `CanWePlace` function to assess whether it's feasible to place `m` cows with at least distance `mid` between them:
       - If feasible (`CanWePlace` returns true), update `answer` to `mid` and adjust `low` to `mid + 1` to search for a larger distance.
       - If not feasible, adjust `high` to `mid - 1`.

3. **CanWePlace Function**: 
   - Iterate through the sorted `position` array to check if it's possible to position `m` cows with at least `dist` distance apart.
   - Begin placing cows from the first position and examine each subsequent position:
     - If the distance between the current position and the last placed cow is at least `dist`, place another cow.
     - Continue until all `m` cows are positioned or it becomes impractical to place them with the given distance.
   - Return true if it's possible to position all `m` cows with at least `dist` distance apart; otherwise, return false.

### Complexity
- **Time complexity**: 
  - Sorting the `position` array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
  - Each binary search iteration involves evaluating feasibility using `CanWePlace`, which operates in \(O(n)\) time.
  - Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n \log D)\), where \(D\) represents the range of distances between positions.

- **Space complexity**: 
  - Sorting the `position` array requires \(O(n)\) additional space.
  - The binary search and `CanWePlace` function use constant additional space, yielding an overall space complexity of \(O(n)\).

This approach ensures efficient determination of the maximum feasible minimum distance `d` using binary search coupled with a feasibility-check function (`CanWePlace`), aligning with the problem's constraints and objectives.
