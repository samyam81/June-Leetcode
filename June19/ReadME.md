# Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets: June 19

## Intuition
The problem requires finding the minimum number of days needed to produce at least `m` bouquets, each consisting of `k` consecutive flowers from an array `bloomDay`.

## Approach
The solution employs binary search to determine the minimum days (`mid`) required. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - Start with `left` set to 1 (minimum possible days) and `right` set to 1,000,000,000 (an arbitrary large number).
   
2. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - Calculate `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.
   - Use the `canMakeBouquets` function to check if it's possible to form `m` bouquets of `k` flowers each within `mid` days.
   - If possible (`true` returned), update `result` to `mid` and adjust `right` to `mid - 1` to search for a smaller number of days.
   - If not possible (`false` returned), adjust `left` to `mid + 1` to search for more days.
   
3. **canMakeBouquets Function:**
   - Iterate through `bloomDay` to count consecutive days (`flowers`) where flowers can be picked.
   - Whenever `flowers` reaches `k`, increment the `bouquets` count.
   - Return `true` if `bouquets` reaches `m`, indicating the condition is satisfied within `days` days.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Check if `m * k` (total required flowers) exceeds the length of `bloomDay`. If true, return `-1` since forming the required bouquets is impossible.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** 
  - Binary search operates in `O(log(max(bloomDay)))`.
  - The `canMakeBouquets` function iterates over `bloomDay` once, making it `O(n)`.
  - Overall time complexity is `O(n log(max(bloomDay)))`, where `n` is the length of `bloomDay`.
  
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is `O(1)` since only a few additional variables are used beyond the input.

This approach efficiently finds the minimum number of days required using binary search and validates the condition using a helper function, ensuring optimal performance for the given problem constraints.
